Literally it's my personal documentation based on my experiences during learn about programming etc. But, it might be helpful to everyone. Anyway it would be contain random docs.

<h2>How to upload your project to Github repository</h2>
*Make sure that your project has been put together in one folder and you had installed Git in your computer.
And i recommend you to login first to Github account before push your project. Don't forget to creat new repository for your project.

1. Right click to your selected project folder.
2. Select Git Bash here.
3. Type these commands gradually:
<ul>
  <li>git init</li>
  <li>git add *</li>
  <li>git commit -m "<i>commit</i>"</li>
  <li>git remote add origin https ://github.com/<i>yourUsername</i>/<i>yourRepository</i>.git</li>
  <li>git push origin master</li>
  </ul>
  
  *note: the italic words above means you could change it.
  
  <b>FINISH.</b>
